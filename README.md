# Reservation
#Application Reservation  This is the repo for our work on Techno web course.  The idea was to use the **MVC** Design pattern in order to make a web application  with a *controller*, a *model* and some *views*.  - The **Controller** is the main program that have to make the interaction between  the view, set the session, protect the code, etc. - The **Model** is the script where the data from the user will be save - The **Views** are the different pages that are display on the website
